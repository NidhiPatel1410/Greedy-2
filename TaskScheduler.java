// In this problem, using a hashmap and storing the frquency of each task, arranging the task with max frequency first by putting
// n intervals between all it's occurences. If more than 1 task have max frquency, arranging them first as pairs. Then, calculating
// how many partitions we did, based on that partitions, calculating how many empty spaces we have. And then how many tasks are
// pending to be schedule. Then how many idle spaces left, adding it to the tasks.length will give us the answer.
